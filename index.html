        <div><pre><b> 
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

I can feel it
Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
I can see myself and I'm not breathing, ah
I'm not breathing <i><small>(I'm not breathing)</small></i>, slowly bleeding <i><small>(bleeding)</small></i>
I wish that I told you all my feelings <i><small>(feelings)</small></i>
I hope that I live life for a reason <i><small>(reason)</small></i>
But at least you'll play this song when I'm gone

And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you
Take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you
Now we're strangers

And I hope that you still cry for me like I cried for you
Every night for you
I've been living with this lie, now I can't hide the truth
I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah

I can't see clear, I wash my fears
With whiskey tears
I disappear, don't interfere
The end is near
The crowd will scream, I block my ears
To stop the cheers
'Cause this stage took a toll, been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone

And I hope you'll cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you
Take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you
Now we're strangers

And I hope that you still cry for me like I cried for you
Every night for you
I've been living with this lie, now I can't hide the truth
I can't hide the truth <i><small>(hide the truth)</small></i>
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah

Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly <i><small>(slowly)</small></i>
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me <i><small>(over me)</small></i>
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fuckin' mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home

And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you
Take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you
Now we're strangers

And I hope that you still cry for me like I cried for you
Every night for you
I've been living with this lie, now I can't hide the truth
I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
